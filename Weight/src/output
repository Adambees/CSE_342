type two integers for w6: w1 = -2 lb -13 oz
w2 = 2 lb 13 oz
w3 = 2 lb 5 oz
w4 = 1 lb
w5 = 0 oz
w6 = 4 lb 5 oz
-w4 = -1 lb
w1 + w2 + w3 = 2 lb 5 oz
w1 - w2 - w3 = -7 lb -15 oz
w1 * 22 = -61 lb -14 oz
Ratio ( w1 / w2 ) = -1
w1 / 2.5 = -1 lb -2 oz
w1 <= w2 is true
w2 >= w3 is true
w3 > w4 is true
w4 < w5 is false
w1 == w1 is true
w1 != w1 is false
(w5 += w1) += w2 is 0 oz
(w5 = 0) is 0 oz
(w5 -= w1) -= w2 is 0 oz
(w1 *= 11) *= 2 is -61 lb -14 oz
(w1 /= 2) / w3 is -13.3784
DIVIDE BY ZERO w1 / w5 = -inf
